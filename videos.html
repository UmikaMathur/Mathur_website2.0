      <h3>What makes us human?, Digital Video, 2018</h3>
      <p>The following found footage is a collection of visuals from the documentary, HUMAN on YouTube and audio from Soundcloud meant to bring about reflection and question. The concept I had in mind is the question: What makes us human? I envision this installation to be played in a dimly lit room with a vast projection of this video on a wall, and those who view it can sit on bean bags and be able to reflect or connect (or both) with the video on a deeper level. I chose to appropriate the material I found from a documentary about humanity because I wanted to communicate the same topics in my video as well and I admired the variety of diverse individuals and footage that I found when I envisioned what I wanted to communicate through this project; the original documentary was presented on YouTube in its full length, and I used and edited certain clips I admired for this video project.</p>

      <h3>Untitled, Digital Video, 2019</h3>
       p>The following video is a collection clips and footage I collected of various works of art and formed together into my own abstract video. For this project, I wanted to explore what is art and what is considered as art to others and myself. Is it allowed to be something simple, or complex? In this video I wanted to communicate the diversity we can find in all art and possibly unlearn the preconceived notions we carry with us as far as what we think art is.</p>

      <h3>Calm Confusion, Digital Video, 2019</h3>
      <p>For this project, my vision was for it to be installed in a gallery space with each clip projected on a different wall moving continuously. I wanted the space to feel very simplistic and quiet, so that the viewer can focus on the videos in front of them and they could choose to either sit down on the bench, or stand up and walk around the room that my videos are projected in.</p>

      <h3>Nostalgia, Digital Video, 2019</h3>
      <p>The following video is a combination of clips that personally bring about the feeling of nostalgia to me. For this project, I wanted to explore the feelings of isolation and missing where you are from. College can be a confusing experience, but you have to keep moving on so this video expresses the moments of reflection I often have.</p>

      <h3>umika jr., Web Based Interactive, 2020</h3>
      <p>The tools I used for this project were p5, GitHub Desktop, and Atom. I used the p5 sketchpad to create the base of the code in which you can see the avatar was made on. The reference section in the p5 website was very helpful as well as getting help from other people and watching demos on how to make my avatar come to life by adding animations, and audio visual movements to the avatar. To create its own website for itself, I used GitHub Desktop and Atom to host my project. My inspiration for this avatar was my dog. I made my avatar to look just like her because she is my “spirit animal” in a sense and was the first thing that came to my mind when I thought of what I could create out of this project.</p>

      <h3>randomizer, JavaScript / p5.js, Web Based Interactive, 2020</h3>
      <p>The tools I used for this project were p5, GitHub Desktop, and Atom. I used the p5 sketchpad to create the base of the code in which you can see the randomizer was made on. I chose to use various images of art that are widely known by many people, and art that I myself am currently into studying. I think this gave the effect that art can be random and isn’t meant to necessarily “make sense” to everyone. I used GitHub Desktop and Atom to create its own website for itself and host my project. I made the images animate and grow because I wanted it to allude to the process of making art by starting out with a small idea, and watching it grow into what it can be.</p>
