      <p style="text-align:center;">The digital collages above are made up of three composite images through Photoshop. I meditated on the topic of what life would look like in the years after the pandemic and put together three images which represent different outcomes of what we can only predict to be as our future. Drawing inspiration from the story “Dante’s Inferno”, I treated each image as if it were a layer or a certain dimension that leads into the next one much like in the original story when Dante and Virgil are traveling through the nine circles of Hell. The perspective from driving inside a car and looking out from your windshield is made for the viewer to feel as if they are actually there, driving through the scene itself. The main purpose of this project is to put the question into the viewers mind of what they think life will look like after the pandemic, as well through my interpretation.</p>
