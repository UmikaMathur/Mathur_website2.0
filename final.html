  <!-- paragraph text explaining my content -->
      <p style="text-align:center;">The three digital collages placed above consist of three composite images created through Photoshop. I pondered on the topic of what life could look like in the years after the pandemic and assembled these three images which show multiple outcomes of what we can only predict to be as our future. Inspired by the story “Dante’s Inferno”, I created each image as its own scene as if it were its own layer of a different dimension which leads into the next, similar to the original story when Dante and Virgil are traveling through the nine circles of Hell. The images are created in the perspective of someone who is driving inside a car and looking out of their windshield to feel as if the viewer is actually there, in the scene itself. The main purpose of this project is to put the question into the viewers mind of what they think life will look like after the pandemic, as well through my interpretation.</p>
